## Summary:

This website has been updated to add more filters for inquiries to the table. city, state, country, and shape filter options have been added. A drawback of this design is that the filters are case sensitive, so adding a capital letter will not bring up the results the users are looking for.

### Recommendations for further website development:
- When the filters are used, a number should pop up showing how many entries fit the criteria. 
- The date filter only accepts the date formatting show in these parenthesis (1/10/2012). In order to help correct any user mistakes, a small calender icon could be added that expands when clicked so the user can select a date that will autofill the correct way.
